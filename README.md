## About

## Timeline
*   Started on Sept 16 2022, around 14:10. Completed most routing and main page UI around 15:15.
*   Took two more hours around 18:00 - 20:00 to work on the Play Page. 
*   Took a couple more hours trying to connect to firebase.
*   A brick wall trying to query nested collections, there're just so many versions of firebase for me, each of which has super different snippets.
*   Gonna take more time studying firebase first.

* It is December 16 (wow, exactly three months) 2022. I continued on this project to wrap things up an move on to next chapters. As firebase is still confusing for me and I am now doing backend jobs myself, I just wrote this project in React. The game now works. Nothing fancy but it is functioning well. Took me around 5 hours (~16:30 to ~23:00).
